# Cross-Literature Timeline

## Deliverable Goals

For this timeline, I set out to compare the three C texts provided for this course (Head First C, Modern C, and 21st Century C) at a high level by mapping out the appearance of different fundamental C concepts and where they appear in the literature against one another.

## Notes

### Head First C

*Head First C* has a novel-like structure and delivery. In such a book, the titles serve to capture the high-level concepts covered in each chapter, although there are other tidbits of content that may not directly fall under the title that are taught within these chapters. This book is targeted towards those who have learned another language previously or are familiar with basic coding concepts.

#### Table of Contents

1. Basics to coding in C (40 pages)
2. Pointers and Memory / Strings (72 pages)
3. Small tools (54 pages)
4. Multiple Source Files and Makefiles (50 pages)
5. Structs, Unions, Bitfields (50 pages)
6. Data Structures and Dynamic Memory (44 pages)
7. Advanced Functions (40 pages)
8. Static and Dynamic Libraries (38 pages)
9. Processes and System Calls (32 pages)
10. Interprocess Communication (38 pages)
11. Sockets and Networking (34 pages)
12. Threads (22 pages)

### Modern C

*Modern C* is organized with *levels* which seem to represent a growing comfort level with the language.

#### Table of Contents

##### Level 0: Encounter

1. Getting started
2. The principal structure of a program

##### Level 1: Acquaintance

3. Controls - conditional executions, iterations, multiple selection
4. Computations
5. Basic values and data
6. Derived data types - arrays, pointers, structures
7. Functions
8. C library functions

##### Level 2: Cognition

9. Style - Formatting and naming
10. Organization and documentation
11. pointers
12. The C memory model
13. Storage
14. More involved processing and IO

##### Level 3: Experience

15. Performance
16. Function-like macros
17. Variations in control flow
18. Threads
19. Atomic access and memory consistency

### 21st Century C

*21st Century C* has a similar narraticve structure to *Head First C*. Unlike the other texts, *21st Century C* dedicates the first quarter of the book to setting up the environment, addressing coding practices like debugging, documenting, and testing, and even distribution. This is all done before jumping into the C language content, which starts right off with pointers.

Chapter 7 is titled, "Inessential C Syntax that Textbooks Spend a Lot of Time Covering", while Chapter 8 is titled, "Important C Syntax that Textbooks Often Do Not Cover".

#### Table of Contents

##### Part 1. The Environment

1. Set Yourself Up for Easy Compilation
2. Debug, Test, Document
3. Packaging Your Project
4. Version Control
5. Playing Nice with Others

##### Part 2. The Language

6. Your Pal the Pointer
7. Inessential C Syntax that Textbooks Spend a Lot of Time Covering
8. Important C Syntax That Textbooks Often Do Not Cover
9. Easier Text Handling
10. Better Structures
11. Object-Oriented Programming in C
12. Parallel Threads
13. Libraries

## Timeline

Given my current understanding of the content, I've been able to color-code only come of the chapters that match. As I continue to develop my understanding of what each chapter holds, this timeline will be updated.
