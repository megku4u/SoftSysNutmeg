## Chapter 2: The principal structure of a program

## What does this chapter cover?

- C grammar
- Declaring identifiers
- Defining objects
- Instructing the compiler with statements

The chapter starts by presenting two aspects of C: the syntactical aspects or C grammar, and the semantic aspects, or the C functionality.

### C Grammar

This chapter breaks apart even the symbols present in the code, including the use of brackets/braces, comments, literals, identifiers, functions, and operators. The concept of declaration as being key to C grammar is also highlighted with its own subsection and takeaway.

> Takeaway 0.2.2.1  *All identifiers in a program have to be declared.*

I notice that this chapter equips the reader with the terminology to talk about the smallest components of C code from the beginning. This includes defining what **statements** are.

The explanation of this terminology is done through breaking down the code presented in Chapter 1. After the code is broken down into its smallest pieces, the code's execution is viewed through the lens of a *control flow diagram* (page 14).

### Summary

- C distinguishes the lexical structure (the punctuators, identifiers, and numbers), the grammatical structure (syntax), and the semantics (meaning) of programs.
- All identifiers (names) must be declared such that we know the properties of the concept they represent.
- All objects (things that we deal with) and functions (methods that we use to deal with things) must be defined; that is, we must specify how and where they come to be.
- Statements indicate how things are going to be done: iterations (for) repeat variations of a certain tasks, functions calls (printf(...)) delegate a task to a function, and function returns (return something;) go back where we came from.
