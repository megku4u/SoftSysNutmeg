# Chapter 1: Getting started

## What does this chapter cover?
- Intro to imperative programming
- Compiling and running code
(Taken from page 2)

The first chapter starts by defining C programming as **imperative programming**, which essentially means that operations are expressed in a way similar to the imperative tense in human language.

The reader is now introduced to their first program, which does some basic arithmetic and `printf()`-ing.

Code is tabbed with the filename. This chapter introduces C jargon, like **statement**, and a **function call**.

The takeaways in this chapter are related to what C and C programs are.

This chapter also explains some command-line options for compiling (page 5).

This book also introduces `clang` as a "pickier" `gcc`. This is helpful because it can help the coder diagnose the issue more clearly.

The chapters also have summaries at the end in bullet form of what was covered.
