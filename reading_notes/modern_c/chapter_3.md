# Chapter 3: Everything is about control

## What does this chapter cover?
- Conditional execution with `if`
- Iterating over domains
- Making multiple selections

### Conditional execution

In this chapter, `if`/`else` statements are explained using their formal terminology, like **controlling expression** and **dependent block**. The chapter notes the structural similarity between the `if` and `for` statements.

Together, the `if(...) ... else ...` structure forms a **selection statement**, which provides multiple **code paths**.

When talking about possible **conditions** that can be used, the book introduces 0 = `false` and 1 = `true`, and quickly teaches the reader to avoid redundancy in their code:

> Takeaway 1.3.1.3  *Don't compare to* 0*,* `false`*, or* `true`.

The chapter uses code that implements the *Heron approximation* to demonstrate the use of `while` and `do while` loops. This also provides appropriate opportunities to introduce `continue` and `break` statements.

### Challenge 1

Chapter 3 is where we see our first challenge. It assumes you know different types of sorting algorithms.

Finally, the chapter introduces the `switch` statement.

### Challenge 2

This challenge requires the reader to implement the numerical derivative of a function.

### Challenge 3

Compute the N first decimal places of pi.
