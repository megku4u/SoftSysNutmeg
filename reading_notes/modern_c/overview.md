# Modern C Reading Notes

## Preface

According to the author, Modern C was created with the intent to "motivate [C] users to climb to higher levels of knowledge" as opposed to "quickly writ[ing] or copy[ing] snippets of code that at least do what it's supposed to" (page i).

The first takeaway from the preface is that the user must not mix nor mix up C and C++.

Another note the author makes in the preface is that this C book is not designed for readers who have never programmed before.

## Overall Features of Modern C
- Highlighted **takeaways** after new content is introduced
  - some are deeper than others
    - Ex. "Don't panic." (page 2) vs. "With the exclusion of character types, only pointers of the same base type may alias." (page 154)
- Organization in *levels*
  - 0 (Encounter): basics of C programming
  - 1 (Acquaintance): principal concepts and features (control structures, data types, operators, functions)
  - 2 (Cognition): pointers, memory model, C library interface, code writing and organization
    - The author notes that "anybody who graduated from an engineering school with a major related to CS or programming in C [should] master this level" (page iii)
  - 3 (Experience): performance, renetrancy, atomicity, threads, type-generic programming
- Each level has a mascot!
- The start of each new level has its own preface
- Bulleted summary at the beginning of each chapter
- C *jargon* is indicated with a superscript "C"
- Smaller exercises as footnotes
- Larger challenges throughout the book
- Standard textbook information sectioning (headings/subheadings)

### You will like this book if:
- You like having the vocabulary to describe every part of your code
- You like a "from the ground up" approach in terms of teaching you a coding language
- You have experience with data structures and algorithms, calculus, and linear algebra and are excited to challenge yourself by connecting those concepts to C code

### You will *not* like this book if:

- It can be hard to focus on the monotony of the chapters
  - Reading this book feels like reading an essay due to the tight formatting of it
- You don't like exercises located in the footnotes of a chapter
- You don't really care for having the right C jargon word to describe what you are doing
