# Chapter 9: Style

## What does this chapter cover?
- Writing readable code
- Formatting code
- Naming identifiers

The takeaways in this chapter are centered around good programming style.

> Takeaway C  *All C code must be readable.*

Readable code is constrained to the limits of the humans reading the code. Therefore, it is important to know that short-term memory of the reader and the viewing range are small.

### 9.1 Formatting

Essentially, the most important thing is to be consistent. The book highlights its coding style on page 119. It is good practice to enforce a formatting policy that for all code that has relations.

### 9.2 Naming

I think the takeaways speak for themselves in this section.

> Takeaway 2.9.2.1  *Choose a consistent naming policy for all identifiers.*

> Takeaway 2.9.2.2  *Any identifier that is visible in a header file must be conforming.*

> Takeaway 2.9.2.3  *Don't pollute the global space of identifiers.*

> Takeaway 2.9.2.4  *Names must be recognizable and quickly distinguishable.*

The table on page 121 does a nice job of reiterating the points in this section with a quick visual.

> Takeaway 2.9.2.8  *A global constant identifies an artifact.*

> Takeaway 2.9.2.9  *A global variable identifies state.*

> Takeaway 2.9.2.10  *A function or function macro identifies an action.*
