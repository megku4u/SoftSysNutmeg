## Summary of Chapter 1

Chapter 1 is dedicated to squeezing in many of the key C basics so that the reader can dive into their first program.

The chapter is centered around one program: a card-counting program. With each new introduction to concepts, the code is improved until it is completed at the end of the chapter (page 37).

This chapter is also the reader's first detailed exposure to the layout of the Head First C book. Many programmers who have experience in other languages won't spend too much time in this chapter.
