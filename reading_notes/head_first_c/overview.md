# Head First C Reading Notes

## Overall Features of Head First C

- Images, sometimes over-the-top
- Lots of commentary
- Casual, conversation-like literature, talking directly to reader
- Exercises embedded into the chapter, usually with answers right on the next page
- Reader is encouraged to fill out exercises like a workbook
- Information is delivered in many different ways, including "scenarios", exercises, and comics
- There are many "interludes", including "bullet points" and "there are no Dumb Questions" sections
- There's a lot of notebook-writing style to this book, including arrows pointing to different bits of information in code, jaunty text angles, and more
- Chapters have breaks in them that include "bullet points" to recap key points, and "there are no Dumb Questions" sections to address smaller details or questions that the reader may have had after reading the content that preceded it.

You will like this book if:
- You get easily bored by normal textbook layouts and are willing to adapt to a drastic change
- You enjoy writing in workbooks (I would highly recommend a printed version of this book)
- You're much more of a visual learner
- You don't mind corny and somewhat outdated humor
- You like when examples build on themselves throughout a chapter instead of being one-off code snippets

You will not like this book if:
- You find multiple visuals and "noise" in textbooks to be overwhelming
- You don't like it when key terms are in non-intuitive places, like comments or side sections, as opposed to the main text
