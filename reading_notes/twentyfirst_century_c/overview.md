# 21st Century C Reading Notes

## Overall Features of 21st Century C

- Code examples that are color coded as if they were in an editor
- Icons to suggest suggestions/warnings
- Casual language and some outright mockery of C and other C textbooks
- Exercises that are conceptual-heavy and tie very closely to content covered immediately before
- An ordering structure that prioritizes good practices before introducing everything
- Standard textbook information sectioning (headings/subheadings)

### You will like this book if:

- You enjoy a bit of humor in your textbook
- You would like to do things the best way possible *the first time*
- You enjoy song references
- You want to focus on writing code that is readable and has a friendly UI
- You already have experience writing C code and can jump right in to best practices in modern C
- You really want a book to share information for the sake of it being useful, not necessarily because all other textbooks cover it (see chapters 7 and 8)

### You will *not* like this book if:
- You haven't programmed in C before picking up this textbook
- You like going in-depth to theoretical concepts and proper language/C jargon (see Modern C!)
- You don't like a programming textbook that is incredibly text-dense at times (there's even a comment in the preface that this book doesn't have a ton of code)
- You're looking for a textbook that is easy to use as a quick-reference (none of these books are *truly* that, but this one is organized in the least helpful way to do so)
