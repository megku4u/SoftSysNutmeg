# Reading Goals

The purpose of diving into several texts is to understand the different ways which the fundamentals of C programming are taught.

I focused on the following things:
- Order
- Methods
- Visuals (if any)
- Layout
- Exercises

Please look at the respective textbook Overview files for more detailed summaries of these texts.

- [Head First C](head_first_c/overview.md)
- [Modern C](modern_c/overview.md)
- [21st Century C](twentyfirst_century_c/overview.md)

I also looked at the Downey/Stein paper on the creation of the E:C curriculum at Olin, and summarized my findings [here](downey_stein_curriculum.md).
