# As Students C It: An Investigation of C Textbooks

Megan Ku '22 (she/her), Software Systems Spring 2021

## Project Goals

Currently, Olin's Software Systems class uses Head First C as its default C resource. This book, while good in some ways, may be disorienting and unhelpful to some students. There are also two other textbooks that are provided, though the concept of picking up a textbook that isn't the assigned reading may be daunting and overwhelming for most students. This project culminated in a student-facing graphic that maps out the three textbooks at-a-glance to support them in Software Systems. This graphic compares delivery styles of C content. A student should be able to look at this visual and understand which textbook will best support their needs during the semester.

## Learning Goals

I had three learning goals for this project.

Firstly, I hoped to improve my ability to communicate C-related concepts through the comparison of multiple textbooks. This goal is achieved through annotations of each of the many chapters I read from all of the textbooks, as well as through the development of the final graphic.

Secondly, I hoped to improve my understanding of C fundamentals, particularly with string manipulation and pointers. I've been struggling on the last in-class quizzes, and I purposely put myself in a position to read multiple explanations of these concepts to hopefully make the information "stick" better.

Finally, I wished to improve the course for a future student (a future "Meg Ku", you might say). By exploring non-required texts and developing  a student-friendly graphic, I hoped to set a future Software Systems student up for success. This past year has been incredibly difficult and isolating, so any support that can be created now can only help a future Oliner.

## Project Execution

This project was not focused on code generation; rather, this project focused on analyzing and synthesizing different content delivery methods across C textbooks. I have attached links to relative files in the below sections, but peruse the `reading_notes`, `timeline`, and `final_visual` folders to see my deliverables.

### Timeline

Before diving into chapter readings, I created a [timeline](timeline/timeline.png) of the relative concepts covered, per chapter, in these three textbooks at a high level. This was to help me frame my understanding when I would see the same topics covered in different ways.

### Research and Annotations

The bulk of this project was the individual chapter annotations of each of the three textbooks. These can be found in the [reading notes](reading_notes/reading_goals.md) folder in the GitHub repo. For each textbook, I took detailed annotations regarding the content, delivery, and any relevant exercises. While these deep dives were time-consuming, they were crucial to getting into the mindset of the reader.

I summarized my takeaways for [Head First C](reading_notes/head_first_c/overview.md), [Modern C](reading_notes/modern_c/overview.md), and [21st Century C](reading_notes/twentyfirst_century_c/overview.md) in their respective Overview documents. I encourage you to take a look at these, as they provide more detailed information that was used to create the final visual.

Some highlights from each of the three textbooks include:

##### You will like Head First C if...
- You get easily bored by normal textbook layouts and are willing to adapt to a drastic change

##### You will *not* like Head First C if...
- You don't like it when you can't easily make structured outline notes based on the layout of the chapter

##### You will like Modern C if...
- You like having the vocabulary to describe every part of your code

##### You will *not* like Modern C if...
- You don't like exercises located in the footnotes of a chapter

##### You will like 21st Century C if...
- You really want a book to share information for the sake of it being useful, not necessarily because all other textbooks cover it (see chapters 7 and 8)

##### You will *not* 21st Century C if...
- You're looking for a textbook that is easy to use as a quick-reference (none of these books are *truly* that, but this one is organized in the least helpful way to do so)

### Final Visual

After completing all of these annotations, I summarized my findings in a student-facing [visual](visual/visual.pdf) that directly compares the three textbooks. The intent of this visual is to guide a student to an alternate resource if they find that the default one isn't working for them. A dream outcome of this layout would be to map out every textbook and provide a decision-making tree to fit what a student likes or dislikes in a textbook.

One of the key design decisions in this visual was to actually take screenshots of the relative visuals and features of each book so that a reader could get an initial feel of each one quickly. While I did describe the relative features, I felt it was important for students to actually see them and cross-compare them. I also hesitated and ultimately decided to withhold the information related to why a student may *not* enjoy a textbook. I wanted to present these textbooks with a tone of optimism and not shape students' perceptions too deeply with my own biases. I also didn't dive too much into the order of content, like I did in the timeline visual, because if this is truly a new C programmer, they will struggle to understand the ordering of content they are unfamiliar with.

## Reflection

Within the bounds of my proposal, I completed the MVP in terms of the final deliverable, but went above and beyond in terms of the depth of annotations I completed. Given the context that I was working on this project, this work felt very appropriate and satisfying for me and my learning goals. Over four weeks, I annotated over twenty textbook chapters, and learned a whole lot about C. Even reviewing concepts as I was reading felt very useful, especially when one textbook explained it in a way that stuck when another one didn't.

I also looked at textbooks with a different lens; I would stop and think, "why did the author put this information in a different section instead of with the main paragraph? What were they hoping to achieve?" At times, my notes come with a point of view of me trying to put myself in the author's shoes. This has given me an incredible amount of insight into how textbooks develop their shape and form, and what works for me as a reader (and what really doesn't).

I guess the obvious question to ask is, "which textbook would I choose?" Between the three textbooks (and I really wish I had more bandwidth to look at more than three textbooks), I say that Head First C is still my first pick, mainly because it's the most welcoming to a new-to-C reader. That being said, I think Head First C could be even better if it was paired with excerpts from 21st Century C. The tones are similar, and 21st Century C feels like a textbook you would read after being unhappy with another textbook. Although I admire the take that Modern C pursues, I don't care too much for the C jargon and the elusiveness of exercises in footnotes was too frustrating for me. All of this aside, I think I limited myself by only analyzing three textbooks. There are so many books out there and it would be the most useful to a Softsys student to compare as many at once and pursue the one that feels the best for their needs.

Overall, I'm very satisfied with the amount that I've learned through this textbook deep dive, and hope to use my new insights to direct my peers to different C resources should they need them.

### Learning Styles (and why I didn't focus on them)

This [paper on learning styles](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1539-6053.2009.01038.x) convinced me to diverge from using that analysis in developing the final visual.

### Building the E:C Curriculum at Olin

This [paper written by Prof. Allen Downey and Prof. Lynn Stein of Olin College](https://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/swampy/downey-stein-fie.pdf) (and suggested as a resource from Prof. Steve Matsumoto) discusses the justifications for the original image of the E:C curriculum. I found it incredibly fun to read and think about the justifications for a computing curriculum with a smaller "footprint".
