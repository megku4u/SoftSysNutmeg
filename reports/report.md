# As Students C It: An Investigation of C Textbooks

Megan Ku '22 (she/her), Software Systems Spring 2021

## Project Goals

This project will culminate in a student-facing graphic that maps out the three textbooks at-a-glance to support them in Software Systems. This graphic will compare content order, depth, and areas of focus, and will also compare delivery styles. A student should be able to look at this visual and understand which textbook will best support their needs during the semester. Also, if they wish to deviate from their chosen text, they can do so easily with this guide.

## Learning Goals

I have three learning goals for this project.

Firstly, I hope to improve my ability to communicate C-related concepts through the comparison of multiple textbooks. This goal is achieved through annotations of each of the many chapters I am reading from all of the textbooks, as well as through the development of the final graphic.

Secondly, I hope to improve my understanding of C fundamentals, particularly with string manipulation and pointers. I've been struggling on the last in-class quizzes, and I purposely put myself in a position to read multiple explanations of these concepts to hopefully make the information "stick" better.

Finally, I wish to improve the course for a future student (a future "Meg Ku", you might say). By exploring non-required texts and developing  a student-friendly graphic, I hope to set a future Software Systems student up for success. This past year has been incredibly difficult and isolating, so any support that can be created now can only help a future Oliner.

## Project Execution

The bulk of this project was the individual chapter annotations of each of the three textbooks. These can be found in the [reading notes](reading_notes) folder in the GitHub repo.
