# Exploration of C Learning

## Project Goals

This project is an exploration into the ways which different literature introduces, supports, and emphasizes the basic concepts of C programming. Unlike other projects for this course, this project will be centered around critically analyzing C textbooks and gathering insights related to different modes of delivery.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

The final deliverable will consist of written responses to different resources, generated exercises that may be useful to future SoftSys students, and recommendations for those interested in developing a textbook for teaching C. A successful MVP will look into all three provided texts for the course and cross-analyze them. Envisioned visuals include a side-by-side comparison of when content is covered within the books. I hope to also design a medium-sized project (equivalent to 2-3 SoftSys homeworks) that would help to solidify understanding of this content.

### Stretch Goals

Beyond the MVP for this project, extra "nice-to-have" milestones include developing useful visuals for a potential textbook, creating extra exercises for the reader, and exploring more texts beyond the ones provided for this course. It would also be fascinating to survey other SoftSys students to collect and understand their experiences with the current resources.

## Personal Learning Goals

My learning goals for this project are centered around my initial reaction to both ThinkOS and Head First C after being a student in this course for a few weeks. ThinkOS is an incredibly efficient book, to the point that I'm left wanting more, while Head First C is both an exciting and extremely overwhelming resource. My enjoyment of and tension with these resources has left me curious about the other ways in which this content is delivered, and what clicks with me as a learner. I hope to both build proficiency and confidence with C by putting myself in the perspective of the professor, and improve my ability to communicate C knowledge that I've obtained. After all, one learns the best through teaching others. This work is also meant to indirectly supplement my work as a current instructor for student-led Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) by challenging me to observe diverse teaching styles.

## Planned Resources

My starting point will be the provided textbooks for this course: Head First C, Modern C, and 21st Century C. From there, I may branch off to other texts based on my progress or suggestions provided by the class instructor/CA. I may need to look into scientific papers should I choose to go the route of understanding different learning styles and how those factor into the delivery of the content in the above textbooks.

## Next Steps

The first step is to explore each of the three texts and drawing insights from them. I plan to start with the content that has already been covered in this class, then expand to other concepts that fall in-between what has already been discussed in class. This will be done when I have finished reading and annotating the excerpts of text I want to explore.

I also want to create a visual that would provide an at-a-glance timeline of sorts to show how the content is covered and delivered for each of the texts. While this is taking place, I hope to create an outline of the different points of analysis I want to focus on related to these texts. This would be complete upon the completion of such a visual.

Finally, I hope to start ideating on interesting or exciting themes for a supplemental project. I hope to create a list and then narrow down to my top three ideas.
