# As Students C It: An Investigation of C Textbooks and Exercises

Megan Ku '22 (she/her), Software Systems Spring 2021

## Project Goals

This project will culminate in a student-facing graphic that maps out the three textbooks at-a-glance to support them in Software Systems. This graphic will compare content order, depth, and areas of focus, and will also compare delivery styles. A student should be able to look at this visual and understand which textbook will best support their needs during the semester. Also, if they wish to deviate from their chosen text, they can do so easily with this guide. Due to the work-hours needed to read and annotate several chapters in each of the textbooks, the  graphic alone is the MVP I am confident I can execute on.

If the MVP is attained and I still have more flexibility to go further, I also hope to develop either smaller exercises or a single larger project prompt to supplement the textbook readings. The exercises may be topic specific, while the project may be a scaffolded implementation based off of covered content up until the due date of this project. This could also be a resource for students who are craving more supplemental practice, preparation for a quiz, or are just excited for more C.

## Learning Goals

I have three learning goals for this project.

Firstly, I hope to improve my ability to communicate C-related concepts through the comparison of multiple textbooks. This goal is achieved through annotations of each of the many chapters I am reading from all of the textbooks, as well as through the development of the final graphic.

Secondly, I hope to improve my understanding of C fundamentals, particularly with string manipulation and pointers. I've been struggling on the last in-class quizzes, and I purposely put myself in a position to read multiple explanations of these concepts to hopefully make the information "stick" better.

Finally, I wish to improve the course for a future student (a future "Meg Ku", you might say). By exploring non-required texts and developing  a student-friendly graphic, I hope to set a future Software Systems student up for success. This past year has been incredibly difficult and isolating, so any support that can be created now can only help a future Oliner.

## Project Progress Update

As of March 21st, 2021, most of the chapters for Head First C have been annotated (you can find annotations in the `reading_notes` folder). I also created a timeline to map out the relative content coverage from the three textbooks. You can find this in the `timeline` folder. I also read a paper written by Allen Downey and Lynn Stein related to the formation of Olin's computing curriculum and uploaded my notes as well. Due to unrelated circumstances, the week of March 15th was devoted to self-care and work on this project was put on pause.

I am currently working through closely annotating the other textbook chapters, with the intent of completing that by March 28th. A chapter is considered annotated when the Markdown file of notes is pushed to GitHub. This is a lot of work; I still have upwards of 15 chapters to annotate. I am also reviewing previous exercises in Software Systems, particularly ones from in-class quizzes, to categorize content coverage. Completion of this analysis will be achieved when I have uploaded my thoughts and suggestions as Markdown files in GitHub. Once chapter annotations are mostly completed, I can work on creating a rough draft of the graphic; this will be done once I have created a sketch that maps out where specific information can go, paired with a Markdown file that outlines what information needs to go on the graphic. This will set me up for a smooth completion of a final graphic.
