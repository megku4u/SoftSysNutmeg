# As Students C It: An Investigation of C Textbooks

Megan Ku '22 (she/her), Software Systems Spring 2021

## Project Summary

Currently, Olin's Software Systems class uses Head First C as its default C resource. This book, while good in some ways, may be disorienting and unhelpful to some students. There are also two other textbooks that are provided, though the concept of picking up a textbook that isn't the assigned reading may be daunting and overwhelming for most students. This project culminated in a student-facing graphic that maps out the three textbooks at-a-glance to support them in Software Systems. This graphic compares delivery styles of C content. A student should be able to look at this visual and understand which textbook will best support their needs during the semester.

## Navigating this Repository

I would recommend starting at my [final report](reports/report.md) for this project.

Afterwards, I would recommend exploring the three overview files for the textbooks I annotated:

- [Head First C](reading_notes/head_first_c/overview.md)
- [Modern C](reading_notes/modern_c/overview.md)
- [21st Century C](reading_notes/twentyfirst_century_c/overview.md)

From there, you can feel free to explore the pages of individual chapter notes.

When you're done, take a look at my [timeline](timeline/timeline.png) as well as the related [writeup](timeline/timeline.md). This was created before I actually read the chapters of each book.

Finally, take a look at my [final deliverable](visual/visual.pdf). What textbook speaks to you?
